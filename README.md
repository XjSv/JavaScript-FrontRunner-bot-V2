I highly recommend watching the YouTube video on how to configure it but for those who don't want to here's directions


Letâ€™s get started.

Part 1. Main software installations.

Extract the Front-Runner-Bot-v2.zip anywhere you like that easy for you to find.

Part 2. Editing the settings.

Open the bots main folder and find "config.js" file and open it with a text-editor:

1.Set your public address and private key or your wallet seed if you have a wallet that does not give you the private key

2.Set the Network  1 = ETH , 2 = BNB , 3 = Polygon 



Happy hunting! :)
